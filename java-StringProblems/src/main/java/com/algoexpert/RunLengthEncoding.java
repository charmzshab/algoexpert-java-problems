    /*Run-Length Encodingâœ©
QN3.Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and returns its run-length encoding.
From Wikipedia,"run-length encoding is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data are stored as a single data value and count,rather th an as the original run."For this
problem,a run of data is any sequence of consecutive,identical characters.So the run"AAA"would be run-length-encoded as"3A".
To make things more complicated,however,the input string can contain all sorts of special characters,including numbers.And since encoded data must be decodable,this means that
we can't naively run-length-encode long runs.For example,the run"AAAAAAAAAAAA"(12As),can't naively be encoded as"12A",since this string can be decoded as either
"AAAAAAAAAAAA"or"1AA".Thus,long runs(runs of 10 or more characters)should be encoded in a split fashion;the aforementioned run should be encoded as"9A3A".
Sample Input
 string="AAAAAAAAAAAAABBCCCCDD"
Sample Output
 "9A4A2B4C2D"*/

    public static String runLengthEncoding(String string) {
        // The input string is guaranteed to be non-empty,
        // so our first run will be of at least length 1.
        StringBuilder encodedStringCharacters = new StringBuilder();
        int currentRunLength = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < string.length(); i++) {
            char currentCharacter = string.charAt(i);
            char previousCharacter = string.charAt(i - 1);
            if ((currentCharacter != previousCharacter) || (currentRunLength == 9)) {
                encodedStringCharacters.append(Integer.toString(currentRunLength));
                encodedStringCharacters.append(previousCharacter);
                currentRunLength = 0;
            }
            currentRunLength += 1;
        }
        // Handle the last run.
        encodedStringCharacters.append(Integer.toString(currentRunLength));
        encodedStringCharacters.append(string.charAt(string.length() - 1));
        return encodedStringCharacters.toString();
    }

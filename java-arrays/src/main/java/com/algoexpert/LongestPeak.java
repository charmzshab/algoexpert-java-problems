    /*Longest Peakâœ©
Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest peak in
the array.
A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until they reach
a tip(the highest value in the peak),at which point they become strictly decreasing.At least
three integers are required to form a peak.
For example,the integers1,4,10,2 form a peak,but the integers4,0,10 don't
and neither do the integers1,2,2,0. Similarly,the integers1,2,3don't form a
peak because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the3.
Sample Input
 array=[1,2,3,3,4,0,10,6,5,-1,-3,2,3]
Sample Output
 6//0,10,6,5,-1,-3*/
